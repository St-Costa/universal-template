# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code (and other AI coding agents that read this file) when working in this repository.

## Project overview

<!-- Replace with a short, concrete description: what this project is, who uses it, and what "done" looks like for a typical change. -->

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Tech stack

<!-- List language(s), frameworks, package manager, and any non-obvious infra (database, queue, deploy target). Keep this current — it's the first thing an agent reads. -->

- Language:
- Package manager:
- Test framework:
- Lint/format tooling:
- Deploy target:

## Commands

<!-- Exact, copy-pasteable commands. Agents will run these verbatim. -->

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install deps | `` |
| Run dev server | `` |
| Run tests | `` |
| Run a single test | `` |
| Lint | `` |
| Format | `` |
| Build | `` |
| Type-check | `` |

## Conventions

- Follow the style already present in the file you're editing over any external style guide.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- No speculative abstractions: build what's asked, not what might be needed later.
- Keep functions/files close to the size and shape of neighboring code in the same directory.
- Comment only where the *why* isn't obvious from the code itself.

<!-- Add project-specific conventions: naming, error handling patterns, where business logic lives vs. handlers, etc. -->

## Testing expectations

- New behavior needs a test. Bug fixes need a regression test.
- Run the full test suite before considering a task done; do not just run the one test you wrote.
- Do not weaken or delete a test to make it pass.

### Testing philosophy: coverage by risk, not by percentage

Write as many tests as are *useful* — which is not the same as as many as possible. Apply the same judgment here you'd apply to production code: more tests are only better when each one earns its place.

**Prioritize tests for:**

- Business logic and domain rules — anything encoding "what the product is supposed to do."
- Edge cases: empty inputs, boundary values, concurrent access, malformed data from external sources.
- Every bug fix gets a regression test that fails without the fix and passes with it.
- Code with non-obvious behavior — anything a future reader (human or agent) could plausibly get wrong when modifying it.
- Integration points: anywhere this codebase talks to a database, external API, queue, or filesystem, since these are where real bugs hide and unit tests alone won't catch them.

**Deprioritize or skip tests for:**

- Trivial getters/setters, simple pass-through functions, and framework/library code you don't own.
- Generated code.
- Restating the implementation in test form (a test that just mirrors the function body line-for-line catches nothing).

**Anti-goals — these count against you, not for you:**

- Padding a coverage number with low-value tests (e.g. asserting a constructor doesn't throw) instead of covering actual risk.
- One giant test asserting many unrelated things — prefer focused tests with one clear failure reason each.
- Tests so tightly coupled to implementation details that a harmless refactor breaks them. Test behavior/contracts, not internals.
- Flaky tests left in place "for coverage." A flaky test is worse than no test — fix it or delete it.

When in doubt about whether a test is worth writing, ask: *if this broke, would an existing test catch it, and would that failure be useful signal?* If not, write it. If a test wouldn't tell you anything you don't already know, skip it.

## Git & PR conventions

### Commit automatically, without being asked

In this repository, committing is part of finishing a unit of work — you do not need explicit permission to run `git commit`, and you should not wait to be told. This overrides the general default of only committing when asked.

- **When to commit**: after each logically complete, working change — a bug fixed, a feature/sub-feature working, a refactor landed, docs updated to match a code change. Don't commit broken or half-finished work; don't bundle unrelated changes into one commit; don't wait for an entire multi-step task to finish if it contains several independent complete steps along the way.
- **What to do instead of asking first**: commit, then tell the user what you committed and why, in one line (e.g. "Committed as `abc1234`: fix null check in parser"). Report after, don't ask before.
- **Scope stays local**: this permission covers local commits only. Never push, force-push, rebase published history, or amend an existing commit without being explicitly asked — those remain confirm-first actions per the repo's normal safety rules.
- **Staging discipline still applies**: review what's staged before committing (`git status`/`git diff`), stage specific files rather than `git add -A`/`.` when unrelated changes are present, and check for secrets before committing anything that looks like it might contain them.
- **Exceptions** — do not auto-commit:
  - Mid-edit or exploratory work that doesn't yet build/pass tests.
  - Changes to `.github/workflows/`, other CI/CD config, or anything else listed under "What not to touch without asking" below — confirm first even for a commit.
  - If the user has asked you to hold changes uncommitted (e.g. for their own review before it enters history).

### Commit message format

<!-- Default below is Conventional Commits; replace with the project's actual convention if different. -->

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary, imperative mood, no trailing period>

<body — optional, wrap ~72 cols, explain *why* not *what*>
```

- `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, `ci`
- `scope`: optional, the affected area (module/package/feature name)
- Summary: imperative ("add", not "added"/"adds"), under ~72 chars, describes the change from the reader's perspective, not the process ("fix off-by-one in pagination", not "fixed bug")
- Body: only when the summary alone doesn't explain *why* — link an issue/ADR if relevant. Skip it for small, self-explanatory changes.
- One logical change per commit. If you're using "and" to describe the diff, it's probably two commits.

### Branching and PRs

- Branch naming: <!-- e.g. `feature/short-description`, `fix/short-description` -->
- Keep PRs scoped to one logical change. Explain *why* in the PR description, not just *what*.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or `.env` files. See `.gitignore`.

## What not to touch without asking

<!-- List anything sensitive: migrations, CI/CD config, infra-as-code, generated files, vendored code. -->

- CI/CD workflow files (`.github/workflows/`) — changes here affect every future PR.
- Anything under `docs/adr/` — these are historical records, not living docs; add a new ADR instead of editing an old one.
- `.claude/settings.json`, `lefthook.yml`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `commitlint.config.js` — these govern what Claude itself is permitted to do and what gets checked before a commit lands; loosening them is a trust decision for the user to make, not the agent.

## Architecture notes

<!-- Point to docs/adr/ for detailed decisions. Use this section only for a short map of major components and how they talk to each other. -->

See [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for the reasoning behind major architectural decisions.

## Documentation

When a change needs user-facing or developer-facing documentation (not just code comments), organize it by feature/domain area: `docs/<feature-name>/` rather than by document type. Update docs in the same commit/PR as the code change they describe — don't defer it. See [docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for the full structure and when a feature earns its own doc vs. a section in an existing one.

## Before considering a task done

Run through [docs/ai/review-checklist.md](docs/ai/review-checklist.md) — it consolidates the checks scattered across this file into one pass.

## Keeping this file useful

This file should describe the *current* state of the project, not its history. When you make a change that invalidates something above (a new command, a changed convention, a new "don't touch" area), update this file in the same PR. See [docs/ai/maintaining-claude-md.md](docs/ai/maintaining-claude-md.md) for guidance.
